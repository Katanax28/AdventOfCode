You might need to run `dotnet restore` before executing the project.
If that doesn't work, make sure dotnet 8.0 is installed on your device.
If you are still seeing errors like "cannot resolve 'system'" please make sure your IDE uses the correct SDK file path in Settings > Build > Toolset and Build > .NET CLI executable path
